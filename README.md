# IoT-Temperature-and-Humidity-Monitor-with-ESP32
This project is an IoT-based solution for monitoring temperature and humidity using an ESP32 microcontroller. It leverages a DHT21 sensor for environmental data collection, and serves this data over a web interface hosted on the ESP32. Users can also toggle a connected lamp through the web interface and download recorded data.
